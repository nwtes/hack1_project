# Learn-the-World — Interactive Map Quiz

A compact single-page web app that turns a Leaflet world map into a clickable geography quiz. The app is intended for quick learning sessions, classroom demos, or embedding into a static site. It focuses on low friction: a simple question card, immediate map feedback (green/red borders), and a timed "bullet-quiz" mode.

## Live demo / screenshots

Below are placeholders for screenshots — replace these files with actual screenshots from your local run and include the images in the repository (for example `screenshots/01-landing.png`). Each screenshot has a short description and the user benefit.

- `screenshots/01-landing.png` — Landing view with global map and search bar. Value: shows the map-first UI with quick search and visual focus on geography.
- `screenshots/02-question-card.png` — Question card open with the quiz prompt. Value: demonstrates how the app presents a question and lets the user click countries to answer.
- `screenshots/03-correct-feedback.png` — Country border turned green after a correct guess. Value: visual confirmation of success for fast learning reinforcement.
- `screenshots/04-timer-mode.png` — Timed (bullet) quiz in progress with timer/score UI. Value: shows the timed challenge mode for engagement and spaced repetition.

Include small captions under each screenshot highlighting the user benefit (memory reinforcement, low-latency feedback, accessibility, etc.).

## Purpose & user value

- Teach world geography with immediate visual feedback — users click map features instead of typing long names.
- Low-friction UX for repeated practice: quick questions, a persistent score, and an optional timed mode for more challenge.
- Lightweight and easily deployed as static files — works well in classrooms, workshops, or as a demo on GitHub Pages.

## Key features

- Clickable Leaflet world map with GeoJSON country layers.
- Search bar for direct lookup and zoom-to-country.
- Question generator (uses a curated `top65.json` pool and REST Countries fallback when available).
- Immediate visual feedback: borders turn green (correct) or red (wrong).
- Timed "bullet-quiz" mode with score and brief timer deltas.
- Simple dark-mode toggle using CSS variables.

## UX design & process (concise)

1. Goals:
   - Fast feedback loop (click → result).  
   - Minimal text entry; map-first interaction.  
   - Accessible, with keyboard bindings for search and an unobtrusive UI.

2. Wireframes & mockups:
   - Wireframe A: Full-screen map with floating controls (search, timer, score).  
   - Wireframe B: Question card slides up from bottom; large central prompt and actionable buttons.  
   - Mockup: Visual styling with calming blue accent, rounded cards, and high-contrast borders for correct/wrong states.

3. Iterations & reasoning for changes:
   - Split the original monolithic script into modular files (`map-init.js`, `geo-data.js`, `map-interactions.js`, `bullet-quiz.js`, `uiAnims.js`) to improve maintainability and isolate responsibilities.
   - Replaced transient animations with deterministic border color toggles (green/red). Rationale: SVG/Leaflet animations were brittle across browsers and reduced accessibility; color toggles are robust and immediately visible.
   - Added CSS variables and a theme toggle to support dark mode with minimal duplication.
   - Defensive programming: wrapped risky DOM/animation calls with try/catch to prevent visual helper errors from breaking core logic.

4. Wireframe / mockup artifacts
   - Attach sketches or PNG exports of the original wireframes into `design/` or `screenshots/` as you refine them. Include brief notes about decisions (why the question card is bottom-docked, why the search sits centered, etc.).

## How it works (technical summary)

- `index.html` — loads Leaflet, app scripts and styles. Script order matters: Leaflet → geo-data → map-init → uiAnims → map-interactions → bullet-quiz.
- `scripts/geo-data.js` — loads local GeoJSON (`assets/custom.geo.json`) and optionally enriches country metadata via REST Countries API. It builds lookup tables used by the quiz generator.
- `scripts/map-init.js` — initializes the Leaflet map and global references.
- `scripts/map-interactions.js` — contains click/hover handlers, card open/close logic, and question generation wiring.
- `scripts/bullet-quiz.js` — timer/score logic for the timed mode.
- `scripts/uiAnims.js` — lightweight helper exposing `markCountryCorrect` / `markCountryWrong` (now simplified to set border color only).

## Data and attribution

- Map rendering and interaction: [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) (BSD-2-Clause).  
  - Leaflet CSS/JS is loaded from unpkg in `index.html`.
- Country metadata: REST Countries v3 (used as an optional enrichment source).  
- Curated question pool: `assets/top65.json` (included in repo).  
- Portions of code were adapted from small Leaflet examples and public patterns for GeoJSON layer handling — these are standard usage patterns and are attributed to Leaflet documentation and examples.

If you included any third-party snippets beyond the libraries above, add explicit attribution here and preserve license text as required.

## How to run (development)

Requirements: a modern browser and a static file server. You can use the built-in Python server or a simple PowerShell command.

From the project root (PowerShell):

```powershell
# option 1: Python 3 simple server
python -m http.server 8000

# option 2: use PowerShell (serves current directory)
# (requires .NET / PowerShell features available in Windows)
npx http-server -p 8000  # if you have npm and http-server installed
```

Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Notes: If REST Countries is blocked or unavailable, the app falls back to `assets/top65.json` for question generation.

## How to run tests / verify behavior

- Open the console and check for errors during load: ensure Leaflet is loaded before other scripts.  
- Verify clicking a country turns its border green for correct / red for incorrect.  
- Toggle dark mode with the bottom-left button and confirm colors swap.

## File map (important files)

- `index.html` — main single-page shell.  
- `styles/main.css` — app styles and theme variables.  
- `scripts/map-init.js` — map initialization.  
- `scripts/geo-data.js` — GeoJSON loading and country metadata.  
- `scripts/map-interactions.js` — user interaction handlers and quiz wiring.  
- `scripts/bullet-quiz.js` — timed quiz logic.  
- `scripts/uiAnims.js` — minimal visual helper for result coloring.  
- `assets/top65.json` — curated question pool.  
- `assets/custom.geo.json` — GeoJSON file containing country geometry.

## Accessibility & UX considerations

- Reduced-motion preference respected: transient animations were removed and the app uses color/state changes as primary feedback.  
- Buttons include `aria-pressed` and role attributes in the score/timer regions; more ARIA labeling can be added for full screen-reader support.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or PRs. Suggested small improvements:  
- Add automated build / preflight checks (ESLint).  
- Add unit tests for question generator and GeoJSON normalization helpers.  
- Improve accessibility (keyboard-only quiz flow, screen reader labels).

## License

This project combines original code with open-source libraries (Leaflet). Unless you add a separate license file, treat the repository as MIT by default for your own code and follow library licenses for third-party code.

If you'd like, I can also:
- produce a printable one-page project summary for a slide or demo.  
- export the wireframes into PNGs and add them to `design/`.
- reflow `styles/main.css` into clearly labeled sections for easier maintenance.

Replace these placeholders with real screenshots and any extra attributions you need, and I will update the README with the actual images and captions.
